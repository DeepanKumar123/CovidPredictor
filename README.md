# CovidPredictor
Covid cases predictor using ML, based on Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4

Implemented autoregressive model with lasso/ridge penalisation.

Was coded after competition closing date, but would have placed 38th out of 472 entries on public leaderboard, using root mean squared logarithmic error.
